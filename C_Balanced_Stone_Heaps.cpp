// There are n heaps of stone. The i-th heap has hi

// stones. You want to change the number of stones in the heap by performing the following process once:

//     You go through the heaps from the 3

// -rd heap to the n
// -th heap, in this order.
// Let i
// be the number of the current heap.
// You can choose a number d
// (0≤3⋅d≤hi), move d stones from the i-th heap to the (i−1)-th heap, and 2⋅d stones from the i-th heap to the (i−2)
// -th heap.
// So after that hi
// is decreased by 3⋅d, hi−1 is increased by d, and hi−2 is increased by 2⋅d
// .
// You can choose different or same d

//     for different operations. Some heaps may become empty, but they still count as heaps. 

// What is the maximum number of stones in the smallest heap after the process?
